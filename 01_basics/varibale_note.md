# Variable
Variable are containers for storing data values.
__Example__
```
number = 5
name = "Rabindra"
print(number)
print(num)
```


### Creating Variable:
- Python has no command for declaring a variable.
- A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
- Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
__Example__
```
random_number = 5 # random_number is of type integer (int)
username = "Ashutosh" # username is of type string (str)
print(number)
print(num)
```

### Casting:
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
___Example__
```
num1 = str(3)   # x will be '3'
num2 = int(3)   # x will be 3
num3 - float(3) # x will be 3.0
```

### Varibale Type:
You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
__Example__
```
x = 5
y = "Sujan"
print(type(x))  x will be int
print(type(y))  y will be str
