# comment in Python
- Comments can be used to explain Python code.
- Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
- Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

### Creating Comment in Python
Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
__Example__
```
#This is a comment.
print("Hello World!")
print("Anoter way") # This is also comment
```
### Multiline Comments
Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
__Example__
```
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```
